Once customized, these new apps can be easily deployed to the Internet.  \n\nKoji's apps are modern \"Progressive Web Apps\" that run on any browser and every device, without the need to install anything, and completely bypassing mobile app stores. This means that any app built on Koji can instantly be used on personal computers, mobile phones, tablets, and any consumer electronics device that has a browser (refrigerators, televisions, game consoles, Facebook Portal, Tesla automobiles)... everywhere!\n\nJust like YouTube started with people posting low quality videos (that later got dramatically better), today, people are creating various trivialities using Koji.  You can see what they are creating here.  We are already seeing these apps get more sophisticated, people learning from each other, a community of developers building, and app template creation accelerating.  Because Koji supports modern day standards (full-stack JavaScript), there are no limitations on the kinds of apps that will be created.\n\nThe company has raised $6M to date from a list of prominent investors [GoMeta, Inc.](http://goMeta.io)\n","how_to_buy_domain":"Placeholder for information on how to buy a domain name.\n\ntl;dr: go to [Google Domains](https://domains.google)","how_to_configure_custom_domain":"# Success!\n\n## Next steps\n\nGo to your domain registrar's DNS settings and create a `CNAME` record from your domain to `cnames.withkoji.com`.

(“GoMeta,” “Koji,” “we,” and “us”) know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.  **By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.**\n\nRemember that your use of GoMeta’s Services is at all times subject to the [Terms of Use](http://gokoji.com/terms) , which incorporates this Privacy Policy.  Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the [Terms of Use](http://gokoji.com/terms).\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What does this Privacy Policy cover</span>?**\n\nThis Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage.  We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. \n\nAs noted in the [Terms of Use](https://gokoji.com/terms), we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 16, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at contact@gometa.io.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Will GoMeta ever change this Privacy Policy</span>?**\n\nWe’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on the Services, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means.  Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them.  If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What Information does GoMeta Collect</span>?**\n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Information You Provide to Us:</span>_\n\nWe receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us.  For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as the following:\n\n\n\n*   First and last name \n*   Email address\n*   Telephone number\n*   Credit/debit card information\n\nIf you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, if you log in our Services through your Google account.  Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.  \n\nWe may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services.  Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services.  If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by contacting us at contact@gometa.io\n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Information Collected Automatically</span>_\n\nWhenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.  We may also use it to improve the Services – for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.\n\n**Cookies:  **“Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people.  Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Cookies can either be “session cookies” or “persistent cookies”.  Session cookies are temporary cookies that are stored on your device while you are visiting our Website or using our Service, whereas “persistent cookies” are stored on your device for a period of time after you leave our website or Services.  We’ve provided a quick summary of some of the cookie types we and our service providers use on the Services, but for more information about cookies, visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). \n\n \n\n\n\n*   **Essential Cookies:**  Essential cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these cookies will make certain features and services unavailable.\n*   **Functional Cookies:**  Functional cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name, and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).\n*   **Performance/Analytical Cookies:** Performance/analytical cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the website, what pages visitors view on our website and how long visitors are viewing pages on the website. Performance/analytical cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Service’s content for those who engage with our advertising.\n*   **Retargeting/Advertising Cookies:** Retargeting/advertising cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you.\n\nWe may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns.  We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. Also, if you click on a link to a third party website or service, such third party may also transmit cookies to you.  Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.\n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</span>_\n\nThrough cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Will GoMeta Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives</span>?**\n\nWe may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:\n\n**Information that’s been de-identified.  **We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.\n\n**Advertisers:** We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.  Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.  Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.\n\nWe may deliver a file to you through the Services (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network.  Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.  Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites.  Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.  You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don’t control whether or how these third parties comply with Do Not Track requests.\n\n**Affiliated Businesses:** In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.  One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account; for example, if you log onto our Services through your Google account.  We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.\n\n**Analytics: **We may use third party analytics service providers, such as Google Analytics for our business purposes, including but not limited to improving and developing our Services, monitoring and analyzing use of our Services, and increasing the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services.  Google Analytics may collect and retain some information about you by planting a persistent cookie or identifier on your web browser or device. You may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/). Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your use of the Services is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics by visiting [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). \n\n**Agents:** We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. \n\n**User Profiles and Submissions:_ _**Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any content that you have uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services.  Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others.  Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone.  Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments.  Additionally, if you sign into the Services through a third party social networking site or service, your list of “friends” from that site or service may be automatically imported to the Services, and such “friends,” if they are also registered users of the Services, may be able to access certain non-public information you have entered in your Services user profile.  Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.\n\n**Business Transfers:** We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.**  **Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal Information with the party that is acquiring our assets.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.\n\n**Protection of GoMeta and Others:** We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with applicable law or court order or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](http://gokoji.com/terms) and other agreements; prevent spam or other unwanted communications and investigate or protect against fraud; protect the rights, property, or safety of GoMeta, our employees, our users, or others; or maintain the security of our products and services.  \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Is Personal Information about me secure</span>?**\n\nYour account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.\n\nWe endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What Personal Information can I access</span>?**\n\nThrough your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:\n\n\n\n*   First and last name \n*   Email address\n*   Telephone number\n*   Credit/debit card information\n*   User profile information, including code, images, and videos you have uploaded to the site\n\nThe information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change.  If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at contact@gometa.io.  \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What choices do I have</span>?**\n\nYou can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.\n\nYou may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above.  When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.  You may request deletion of your account by sending an email to contact@gometa.io.  Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.  \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">EU Residents</span>**\n\nIf you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.  \n\nFor this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. GoMeta will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Services.\n\nIf there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict.  If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at contact@gometa.io.  \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What Personal Data Do We Collect From You?</span>** We collect Personal Data about you when you provide such information directly to us, when third parties such as our business partners or service providers provide us with Personal Data about you, or when Personal Data about you is automatically collected in connection with your use of our Services.  For more information, please refer to “**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What Information does GoMeta Collect</span>?**”\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">How Do We Use Your Personal Data?</span>  **We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services.  For example, we use Personal Data to:\n\n\n\n*   Create and manage user profiles\n*   Communicate with you about the Services\n*   Process orders \n*   Contact you about Service announcements, updates or offers\n*   Provide support and assistance for the Services\n*   Personalize website content and communications based on your preferences\n*   Meet contract or legal obligations\n*   Respond to user inquiries\n*   Fulfill user requests \n*   Comply with our legal or contractual obligations\n*   Resolve disputes\n*   Protect against or deter fraudulent, illegal or harmful actions\n*   Enforce our Terms of Service\n\nWe will only process your Personal Data if we have a lawful basis for doing so. Lawful bases for processing include consent, contractual necessity and our “legitimate interests” or the legitimate interest of others, as further described below.\n\n\n\n*   **Contractual Necessity:**  We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Services.  When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Services that require such data. \n    *   Your full name\n    *   Your email address\n*   **Legitimate Interest:**  We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties.  \n    *   Your phone number\n    *   Your IP address\n\n        Examples of these legitimate interests include:\n\n    *   Operation and improvement of our business, products and services\n    *   Marketing of our products and services \n    *   Provision of customer support\n    *   Protection from fraud or security threats\n    *   Compliance with legal obligations\n    *   Completion of corporate transactions \n*   **Consent:**   In some cases, we process Personal Data based on the consent you expressly grant to us at the time we collect such data.  When we process Personal Data based on your consent, it will be expressly indicated to you at the point and time of collection. \n*   **Other Processing Grounds:**  From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">How and With Whom Do We Share Your Data?</span>**  We share Personal Data with vendors, third party service providers and agents who work on our behalf and provide us with services related to the purposes described in this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?</span>  **We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you personally.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What Security Measures Do We Use?</span>**  We seek to protect Personal Data using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data and applicable processing activity. \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Personal Data of Children</span>:  **As noted in the [Terms of Use](http://gokoji.com/terms), we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16.

In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the nature of your request.  \n\n\n\n*   **Access**:  You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data.\n*   **Rectification**: If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data.

(“GoMeta,” “Koji,” “we,” and “us”).  You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document, as well as those in the [Privacy Policy](https://gokoji.com/privacy) and [Copyright Dispute Policy](https://gokoji.com/copyright).\n\n**NOTICE: Please read these Terms carefully.** They cover important information about Services provided to you and any charges, taxes, and fees we bill you. **These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. **\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Will these Terms ever change?</span>**\n\nWe are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the [https://goKoji.com](https://goKoji.com) website, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. \n\nIf you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. \n\nExcept for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us. \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What about my privacy?</span>**\n\nGoMeta takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current GoMeta Privacy Policy, [please click here](https://gokoji.com/privacy).\n\nThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from a child under 16 without obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or guardian (“Parental Consent”), except for the limited amount of personally identifiable information we need to collect in order to obtain Parental Consent (“Required Information”). Until we have received Parental Consent, we will only use Required Information for the purpose of obtaining Parental Consent. If you are a child under 16, please do not attempt to send any personal information about yourself to us before we obtain Parental Consent, except for the Required Information in the context of the Parental Consent process. If you believe that a child under 16 has provided us with personal information (beyond the Required Information) without our obtaining Parental Consent, please contact us at [contact@gometa.io](mailto:contact@gometa.io).\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What are the basics of using Koji?</span>**\n\nYou may be required to sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“Koji User ID”).

If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).\n\nYou will only use the Services for your own personal use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.

This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.\n\nIf you store a User Submission in your own personal GoMeta account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant GoMeta the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.\n\nIf you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users)(a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant GoMeta the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so.

We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Do the Services cost anything?</span>**\n\nThe Services may be free or we may charge a fee for using the Services.  If you are using a free version of the Services, we will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services. Note that if you elect to receive text messages through the Services, data and message rates may apply. Any and all such charges, fees or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges, fees or costs may apply to your use of the Services.\n\n\n\n1. **Paid Services**. Certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”).  Please see our [Paid Services page](http://gokoji.com/paidservices) for a description of the current Paid Services. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms.\n2. **Billing**. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.\n3. **Payment Method**. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.\n4. **Recurring Billing**. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, GO TO [ACCOUNT SETTINGS](http://gokoji.com/profile/me)**.**\n5. **Current Information Required**. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT [ACCOUNT SETTINGS](http://gokoji.com/profile/me).  IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.\n6. **Change in Amount Authorized**. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.\n7. **Reaffirmation of Authorization**. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.\n\n**Free Trials and Other Promotions**. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at contact@gometa.io.\n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What if I want to stop using the Services</span>? **\n\nYou’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at contact@gometa.io; please refer to our [Privacy Policy](http://gokoji.com/privacy), as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. \n\nGoMeta is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms.  GoMeta has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.\n\nAccount termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. \n\nProvisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement. \n\n**<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">What else do I need to know?</span>**\n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Warranty Disclaimer.</span>_ Neither GoMeta nor its licensors or suppliers make any representations or warranties concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL GOMETA (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO GOMETA IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (III) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. \n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Indemnity</span>_. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, You agree to indemnify and hold GoMeta, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any third party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. \n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Assignment</span>_. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without GoMeta’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.\n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Choice of Law</span>_. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof. \n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Arbitration Agreement.</span>_ PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH GOMETA AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. Both you and GoMeta acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, GoMeta’s officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third party beneficiary hereof.\n\n(a) _Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement_. Any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco County, California. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (\"JAMS\") then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. \n\n(b) _Costs of Arbitration_. The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. GoMeta will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. GoMeta will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous. \n\n(c) _Small Claims Court_. Furthermore, either you or GoMeta may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in San Francisco, California or any United States county where you live or work. \n\n(d) _Waiver of Jury Trial**. **_YOU AND GOMETA WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and GoMeta are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and GoMeta over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND GOMETA WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.\n\n(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor we are entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.** **\n\n(f) _Opt-out_. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: GoMeta, Inc.  600 B Street, San Diego, CA 92101postmarked within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (1) your name and residence address; (2) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account; and (3) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.\n\n(g) _Exclusive Venue_. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or GoMeta to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party and both you and GoMeta agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, San Francisco, California, or the Northern District of California. \n\n_<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Miscellaneous</span>_. You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the GoMeta may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and GoMeta agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and GoMeta, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of GoMeta, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind GoMeta in any respect whatsoever. \n\nExcept as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and GoMeta agree there are no third party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.\n","withkoji_landing_header":"<style>div.header{margin:0 auto;position:relative;display:flex;align-items:center;padding:12px;background-color:#f1f5f8}div.header video{width:50%;height:100%;object-fit:contain;padding:0}div.header .content{width:100%;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;flex-direction:column;color:#111}div.content h1{font-weight:700;font-size:2rem;margin:0}div.header ul{list-style-type:none;padding:0;font-size:1.25rem;}div.header ul li{padding:0 8px}@media (max-width:750px){div.header{flex-direction:column}div.header video{width:100%}div.content h1{text-align: center;margin-top:6px;}div.header ul{display:none}}</style><div class=header><video preload=\"none\" controls poster=\"https://images.koji-cdn.com/site/koji-homepage-video-2.png?h=500\"src=https://objects.koji-cdn.com/site/koji-homepage-video-1.mp4></video><div class=content><h1>Anyone Can Create Games</h1><ul><li><a href=http://bit.ly/StartWithKoji target=_blank>&dash; Watch &quot;How To&quot; tutorial</a></li><li><a href=https://withkoji.com/create target=_blank>&dash; Start creating</a></li><li><a href=https://withkoji.com/docs target=_blank>&dash; Documentation</a></li></ul></div></div>"};</script><meta charset="utf-8"/><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"/><link rel="icon" href="https://withkoji.com/favicon.ico"/><script>!function(){var o=window.analytics=window.analytics||[];if(!o.initialize)if(o.invoked)window.console&&console.error&&console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");else{o.invoked=!0,o.methods=["trackSubmit","trackClick","trackLink","trackForm","pageview","identify","reset","group","track","ready","alias","debug","page","once","off","on"],o.factory=function(t){return function(){var e=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);return e.unshift(t),o.push(e),o}};for(var e=0;e<o.methods.length;e++){var t=o.methods[e];o[t]=o.factory(t)}o.load=function(e,t){var n=document.createElement("script");n.type="text/javascript",n.async=!0,n.src="https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/"+e+"/analytics.min.js";var a=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];a.parentNode.insertBefore(n,a),o._loadOptions=t},o.SNIPPET_VERSION="4.1.0",o.load("OseQeTdSd9FlD9sGks4f3UxBup9cD9d3")}}()</script><meta name="theme-color" content="#b1624d"/><link rel="manifest" href="https://withkoji.com/manifest.037b1667e321697909d80f29c45b02ae.json"/></head><body><noscript>If you're seeing this message, that means <strong>JavaScript has been disabled on your browser</strong>, please <strong>enable JS</strong> to make this app work.</noscript><div id="app"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/runtime.c38e174bb13a73d82ee8.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.material-ui.79e6113933742870fdea.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.core-js.e1de864edb804497e42b.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.lodash.405bb605d7fd5c5feb1a.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.react-instantsearch-dom.09d287b6dc0ef9019d76.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.react-instantsearch-core.2bd558b4eb05b85deed0.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.sentry.2fd5932cbaf833c2b104.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.remark-parse.97a7762f116b9734eaaf.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.algoliasearch.e53c9f53823ac737a0a1.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/npm.algoliasearch-helper.f4d8df18d74c2c17f0c0.chunk.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="https://withkoji.com/main.5d826cdf0ace6c1348d1.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
